# E-commerce Product Grid - Tech Test

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Demo Link:** [Netlify Demo](https://your-demo-link.netlify.app)

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a technical test submission where I was provided with base e-commerce code and tasked with improving the product grid functionality. The project demonstrates my ability to enhance existing React applications with modern best practices, performance optimizations, and responsive design.

## 🎯 Key Improvements Made

### Performance Optimizations
- **React.memo** for component memoization
- **useMemo** for expensive calculations (variants, truncated text)
- **useCallback** for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **AbortController** for proper API request cleanup
- **Optimized re-renders** by removing inline function creation

### Code Quality & Best Practices
- **PropTypes validation** with detailed shape definitions
- **Clean component structure** with proper separation of concerns
- **Error handling** with proper abort signal management
- **Modern React patterns** (hooks, functional components)

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Responsive grid system** (col-xl-3 col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-12)
- **Product variants** with dynamic pricing
- **Stock management** with visual indicators
- **Loading states** with skeleton components
- **Accessibility improvements** (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

## 🎨 Layout Approach

I implemented a **mobile-first responsive design** using Bootstrap's grid system. The product grid adapts from 1 column on mobile to 4 columns on extra-large screens, ensuring optimal viewing across all devices. Each product card maintains consistent height and spacing while providing clear visual hierarchy.

## 📱 Responsiveness Considerations

The layout uses **Bootstrap's responsive breakpoints** with custom grid classes that ensure products display optimally on all screen sizes. Category filters wrap gracefully on smaller screens, and product cards maintain readability with proper text truncation and touch-friendly button sizes. The skeleton loading states also follow the same responsive grid pattern.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, Create React App
- **Styling:** Bootstrap 5, CSS3
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
- **UI Components:** React Loading Skeleton, React Hot Toast
- **Performance:** React.memo, useMemo, useCallback

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-tech-test.git
cd ecommerce-tech-test
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**
```bash
npm start
```

4. **Open your browser**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎯 Features Implemented

- ✅ **Product Grid Display** with responsive layout
- ✅ **Category Filtering** with dynamic buttons
- ✅ **Product Variants** with dropdown selection
- ✅ **Add to Cart** functionality with Redux
- ✅ **Loading States** with skeleton components
- ✅ **Error Handling** with user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Accessibility** with ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- ✅ **Performance Optimizations** with React hooks

## 🔧 Performance Metrics

- **Component Re-renders:** Minimized using React.memo and useCallback
- **Memory Usage:** Optimized with proper cleanup and memoization
- **Bundle Size:** Maintained through efficient imports
- **Loading Speed:** Improved with skeleton loading states

## 📝 Notes for Reviewers

This tech test demonstrates my ability to:
- **Enhance existing codebases** with modern React patterns
- **Implement performance optimizations** without breaking existing functionality
- **Maintain code quality** with proper TypeScript-like validation
- **Consider user experience** across all device sizes
- **Follow accessibility best practices** for inclusive design

## 🔍 Observation

**Frontend-Only Test:** This assessment focuses exclusively on frontend improvements. The backend server integration has been commented out, and the app uses the FakeStore API for demonstration purposes. Only `npm start` is needed to run the frontend application.
